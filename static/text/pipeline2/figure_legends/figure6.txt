Figure 6a. Violin plots showing mean expression of markers the top markers for each of our 6 clusters that were also identified in the unbiased groups produced by the original study (Darmanis et al., 2015). Figure 6b. Violin plots showing the expression levels of the top markers identified in our clusters, assorted instead by the biased cell type assignments of the original study.
