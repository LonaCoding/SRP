Figures 5a and 5b are heatmaps showing the expression levels of the top markers of our clusters in each of our cells. 5a is ordered by our unbiased Seurat clusters, and 5b is ordered by biased cell type assignments. Associations between our clusters and the biased cell types from the original study can be clearly discerned. Aside from cluster 2, comparison of markers reported for each cell type and the markers observed in our study supported the identification of our clusters as their respective cell types.
