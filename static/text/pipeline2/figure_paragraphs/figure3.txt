Figures 3a and 3b show a 2D UMAP representation of our clusters. 3a shows that we observe some discrepancy between our clusters and the UMAP localisation of our cells in cluster 1, but clusters 2-6 tightly spatially resemble their cluster assignments. 3b shows our UMAP representation of the data with the biased cell type assignments determined in the original study (Darmanis et al., 2015). From these representations, our Seurat analysis did not discriminate between endothelial, foetal replicating, and foetal quiescent cells, all of which are represented by our cluster 1. In addition, we do not differentiate between neuron and hybrid signals, instead finding them mostly mixed in our cluster 2 (figure 3a).

We do observe clusters that seem to correspond well to the determined biased types, such as cluster 3 as astrocytes; cluster 4 as oligodendrocytes; cluster 5 as OPCs; and cluster 6 as microglia. These associations were confirmed with comparisons between markers for our clusters and markers for unbiased groups that were determined to correspond to their respective biased types in Darmanis et al. (2015).
