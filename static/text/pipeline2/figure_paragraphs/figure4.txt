Figures 4a and 4b show 3D UMAP representations of our dataset constructed using the R package 'rgl' (Murdoch and Adler, 2021). These show the relatively tight clustering of our data. Figure 4a is coloured by our Seurat clusters, and 4b is coloured by the biased cell type assignments. The same patterns observable in figure 3 are also present here. It should be noted that we do not find any clusters corresponding strongly to the original study's unbiased groups 7, 8, or 9 (Darmans et al. 2015; Fig. S4).
