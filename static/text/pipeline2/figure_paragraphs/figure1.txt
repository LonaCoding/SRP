The level number of features and molecules counted in a dataset can be used as a measure of the quality of data acquired for each cell. Low feature and molecule counts might be indicative of cells with unusual expression patterns (e.g. apoptotic cells), whilst high counts can be indicative of doublets (wherein two cells have been captured together, and the transcriptome of both cells is represented). Furthermore, high mitochondrial gene coverage in cells can also interfere with downstream analysis of the data (Luecken et al., 2019). The removal of such cells with very high feature counts, molecule counts, or mitochondrial coverage is important in producing biologically meaningful data.

The figure 1 plots demonstrate that there was incredibly high mitochondrial gene coverage in some of our cells, as well as the number of features detected in some cells made them likely candidates for doublets. These cells were removed from the initial dataset of 466 cells, leaving us with a total of 396 cells
