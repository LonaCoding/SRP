A feature expression plot showing the relative expression levels of the top markers of endothelial cells (IFITM1) and replicating foetal cells (TOP2A), suggesting that signals of these cellular communities might be present in our study, but their signal is not strong enough for them to be discerned from cluster 1. Comparing figure 7 to figure 3b indicates that differing methods may be more capable of identifying these subclusters.
