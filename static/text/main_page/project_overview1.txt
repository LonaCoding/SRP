An scRNA-seq study published in 2015 by Stephen Quake's (Darmanis et al., 2015) attempted to capture the transcriptomic diversity of the human brain and use the data to map cells to defined cell types. In this project, we utilised two separate pipelines to analyse the same dataset. We attempted to: 1. Reproduce their results following the original methods employed as closely as possible in our first pipeline, 2. Use the same data with more recent scRNA-seq analysis pipeline, and 3. Present the results from these two analysis pipelines in a website to allow users to interact with the results.
