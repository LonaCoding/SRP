An scRNA-seq study published in 2015 by Stephen Quakeâ€™s (Darmanis et al., 2015) attempted to capture the transcriptomic diversity of the human brain and use the data to map cells to defined cell types. In this project, we utilised two separate pipelines to analyse the same dataset. We attempted to: 1. reproduce their results following the original methods employed as closely as possible in our first pipeline, 2. use the same data with a more recent scRNA-seq analysis pipeline, and 3. present the results from these two analysis pipelines in a website to allow users to interact with the results. Our first pipeline found issues in reproducing their methods due to ambiguity in the supplementary materials and methods provided by the original study which resulted in difficulty in obtaining biologically meaningful results. Our second pipeline, which utilised the popular single-cell analysis suite Seurat, revealed some support for the conclusions of the original analysis in clusters corresponding to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and OPCs. However, we also find discrepancies in the marker signatures for communities representing neurons, and modern analysis methods fail to resolve between foetal quiescent, foetal replicating, and endothelial cell signatures.
