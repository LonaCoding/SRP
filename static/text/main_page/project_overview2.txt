Our first pipeline found issues in reproducing their methods due to ambiguity in the supplementary materials and methods provided by the original study which resulted in difficulty in obtaining biologically meaningful results. Our second pipeline, which utilised the popular single-cell analysis suite Seurat, revealed some support for the conclusions of tje original analysis in clusters corresponding to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and OPCs. However, we also find discrepancies in the marker signatures for communities representing neurons, and modern analysis methods fail to resolve between foetal quiescent, foetal replicating and endothelial cell signatures.
