Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a method employed to determine the properties that make up a cell-population and  can also further be used to distinguish between sub-populations of cells. The main process of scRNA-seq involves capturing transcripts produced by isolated cells through sequencing to produce reads, generating libraries in which the reads are mapped to individual cells. These reads can then be aligned to an indexed genome to determine where the reads originated from, and from there we can count the reads that are associated with genes (Hwang, Lee and Bang, 2018). Afterwards, this data can be used in a variety of analysis pipelines that can produce results from which we can infer biological meaning. One of the main analysis pipelines used for scRNA-seq data is cell clustering which involves clustering cells based on their gene expression profile to distinguish between cell populations (Kiselev, Andrews and Hemberg, 2019).
