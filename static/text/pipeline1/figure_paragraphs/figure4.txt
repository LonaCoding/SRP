It was stated that the foetal sample cells colocalised strongly to two clusters in the original publication (Darmanis et al, 2015). This can also been seen in our data when sample origin (adult or foetal) was mapped to our clusters. Although the distribution of foetal cells does also extend marginally to regions of clusters 9 and 6, the majority of foetal cells lie within clusters 5 and 8.
