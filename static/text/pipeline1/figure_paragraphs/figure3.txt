Clusters are well defined and of a similar distribution to the original data. Rtsne (Krijthe, 2015)parameter ‘perplexity’ was reduced slightly from the default settings to achieve this; not a decision implied in the methods but ascertained via necessary optimisation due to the absence of detail in the original method outline. The largest degree of overlap can been seen between clusters 5 and 8.
