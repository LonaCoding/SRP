Pipeline 1 involved re-producing the original scRNA pipeline conducted by Darmanis et al., (2015). This pipeline involved the trimming  and filtering of reads from the  FASTQ  files originally produced by Darmanis et al., (2015) using Prinseq (v0.20.4). Quality control was then conducted using FastQC (v0.11.2) in which the outputs were then subjected to further trimming and adapter sequence (Nextera adapters) removal using Cutadapt (v2.0) and Trimgalore (v0.4.1). After pre-processing genome indexing was conducted using STAR (v2.4.0h) and the reads were then aligned to the indexed genome.

The SAM files produced were then used to create a count matrix using HTSeq (v0.6.1) to find out how many reads mapped to genes. The values were then converted to counts per million (CPM) and inputted into R (v4.1.3) for clustering analysis.
